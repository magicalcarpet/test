# Python REST API

# Motivation
I like creating REST APIs, so here is an example of a REST API.

# Demo
WIP

# Programming Language
I like to code in Python so this API will be coded in this language.

# Libraries Used
*Django* - Used to create the RESTful Api.

*Behave* - testrunner (Cucumber like BDD tool for python).

*Invoke* - A task runner (We shall use this to quickly execute common tasks).

# Getting Started
You'll need pipenv to run this project, install it if you don't already have on your machine. 

## Pipenv install
In your web browser type the following:

```
https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#install-pipenv-today
```

Follow their instructions.

If all goes well then you can verify your install worked by typing the following in the terminal:

```console
pipenv --version
```

You should see something like this:

```
pipenv, version 2020.8.13
```

Now that you have pipenv installed you need to go into a virtual environment and install your depedencies.

```
pipenv shell
```

Which will chnge into a virtual environment. 
Finally, we need to install our dependencies into our virtual environment.
We can do this by using the following commmand:

```console
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```
